# Graffit-Project

A mock social media platform called GRAFFIT where we have users and brands. Users will be able to keep track of their friends and the brands that they like. They will also know which two brands are similar to each other. This mock social media service will be supporting through the manipulation of a graph network.

This project utilizes the concept of graphs & recursion.
